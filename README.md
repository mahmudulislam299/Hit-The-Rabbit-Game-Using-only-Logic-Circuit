# Hit-The-Rabbit-Game-Using-only-Logic-Circuit

The objective of this project was to develop game “Hit the Rabbit”. In our project we used various
basic logic gates, combinational circuits, and sequential circuits. The Proteus 8 Professional
software was used to simulate the designed circuit to display its function. In this game we
created a clock pulse and that is connected to a pseudo random number generator. The random
number generator is connected to a 3 to 8 line decoder, and the decoder lit one led at a time. The
player’s target is to click the corresponding button that is connected to led. If the player presses
exact button which is connected to the led which is on he will get a point. And in every wrong
press his point will be lessened. The game will be over after 1 minute.
Features:
1. Positive point for right response.
2. Negative point for wrong.
3. Difficulty adjustment.
4. Reset game after some time
